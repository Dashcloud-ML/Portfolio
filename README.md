# Portfolio
# Modern & Minimalist Next.js Portfolio.

👋 **Hello!** Welcome to the GitHub repository showcasing my personal **Portfolio Website** project!  

🚀 **About the Project**:  
This portfolio reflects my journey as a developer and serves as a hub for my achievements, projects, and skills. Built using **React.js**, **Next.js**, **Three.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, it combines sleek design with functionality to deliver an engaging user experience.  

💻 **Key Features**:  
- **Dynamic UI**: Bento grids and infinite loops enhance interactivity and modern appeal.  
- **Functional Integrations**: Tools like **SendGrid** ensure robust capabilities.  
- **Responsive Design**: Deployed on **Netlify**, offering seamless access across devices.  
- **Aesthetic Animations**: Adding a visual edge to the browsing experience.  

🌟 **Development Milestone**:  
This project marks a significant leap from my first HTML-CSS website deployed exactly a year ago. Dedicating an entire day and night to its completion, it represents my dedication, growth, and passion for web development.  

Feel free to explore the repository, share your feedback, and contribute ideas. Let’s build something amazing together! 🌐
